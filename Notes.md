1.) What is Database?

    1. Overview =>
        1. Database is the collection of organized data which is structured or unstructured. The database's primary goal is to store a huge amont of data.
        2. Many Dynamic websites on the Internet today are store in dabases.
        3. There are many Types of Databases which are explained in this article.

    2. Components of Database => There are five Components in which a database is divided.
        1. Hardware
        2. Software
        3. Data
        4. Procedures
        5. Database Access Language

    3. Types of Databases =>
        1. Filed-Based databases => 1968s
        2. Relational databases => 1980s
        3. Object-oriented databases
        4. Distributed databases
        5. NoSQL databases
        6. Graph Databases
        7. Open source Databases
        8. Cloud databases
        9. Evolution of Database

4. A database is an organized collection of data that enables simple and efficient storage, retrieval, and modification of data. There are 11 fundamental types of databases:

Centralized database.
Cloud database.
Commercial database.
Distributed database.
End-user database.
Graph database.
Hierarchical database.
Network database.
NoSQL database.
Objected-oriented database.
Relational database.

<!-- Relational and Non Relational Databases -->
1. Overview =>
     Relational and Non-relational databases are two kinds of management systems that allow us to create databases that will help us in managing complex data. A relational database is structured, whereas NoSQL is semi-structured or unstructured. In the relational database(SQL), it consists of tables(fields and records), whereas non-relational database data is stored in form of graphs, documents(XML, JSON).

2. Introduction =>
    There are two types of database management systems:
        1. Relational Databases.
        2. Non-Relational Databases.

    1. Relational Database =>
        1. A relational database or relational database management system(RDBMS) stores data in the form of a table. The table consists of rows and columns, and in a relational database rows are referred to as records, and columns are referred to as fields

        2. The term relational database was first coined in year 1970s by E.F. Codd at IBM and later in 1974 Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce released SQL or standard Query Language, which allows the user to interact with the relational database system.

        
MySQL Commands =>
    <!-- Some of The Most Important SQL Commands -->
        1. SELECT - extracts data from a database
        2. UPDATE - updates data in a database
        3. DELETE - deletes data from a database
        4. INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
        5. CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
        6. ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
        7. CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
        8. ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
        9. DROP TABLE - deletes a table
        10. CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
        11. DROP INDEX - deletes an index
